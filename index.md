We are the [Semmelweis University](http://semmelweis.hu/english/) Computational
Biology Group, located at the [1st Department of Pathology and Experimental
Cancer Research](http://semmelweis.hu/patologia1/en/).

We are focusing on the computational and systems biology of human diseases. We
aim to provide novel biological insight using existing large-scale public
datasets. Our work is highly interdisciplinary, at the crossroad of biology,
medicine, informatics and data science.
