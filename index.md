The group is located at the [1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer
Research](http://semmelweis.hu/patologia1/en/) of [Semmelweis
University](http://semmelweis.hu/english/).

We are studying the effect of transcriptional and post-transcriptional
expression variance on gene regulatory networks, and the role of this variance
in the early development, drug resistance and metastasis of cancer, with a focus
on hematological malignancies. Additionally, we are working on applying
RNA-sequencing based methods in clinical diagnostics, besides providing
bioinformatics and biostatistics support to the Department.

The group currently receives funding from the Semmelweis University [Directorate
of Innovation](http://semmelweis.hu/innovacios-igazgatosag/), the National
Research, Development and Innovation Office
([NKFIH](https://nkfih.gov.hu/for-the-applicants)), and participates in the
[EPITRAN](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16120/) and
[NUCLEOME](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA18127/) COST research networks.
