## Transcriptome noise as an alternative mutator phenotype in cancer

<img align="left" width="200" height="200" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/5138480.jpg">
Are you interested in analyzing terabytes of experimental data? Do you want to
work on a project, where you need to combine biology, statistics, programming
and answer challenging, interdisciplinary research questions? You think about
bioinformatics, cancer and networks all the time? We are looking for a candidate
to join our computational biology group to work on a new project. Our main goal
will be to investigate gene expression and splicing variance in cancer and the
effect of this variance on somatic mutations and gene regulatory networks.
Characterizing the determinants of variance might help in understanding early
cancer development, drug resistance, metastasis and the varying penetrance of
human diseases.

*What we offer*

- Interdisciplinary research environment, from basic cancer research to digital pathology
- Mentoring according to long-term career goals
- Opportunity to learn cutting edge bioinformatics and genomics

*Required skills*

- Good communication skills in English
- Familiarity with Linux, command line tools and scripting (R, Python, Perl or similar)
- Understanding of eukaryotic transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation

*Application*

If interested, please check that you are eligible, and drop us an email with
your CV, list of publications, together with a short summary of your most
significant scientific contribution and main interests to the following email
address: *sebestyen.endre@med.semmelweis-univ.hu* with “PhD Application -
Transcriptional noise” in the subject.

If you are planning to apply for the Stipendium Hungaricum fellowship, please
send your application by the 5th of January, 2020. If you are eligible for the
state-funded PhD fellowship, please send your application by the 31st of
January, 2020.

*Additional information*

Semmelweis University is the oldest medical university in Hungary, integrating
education, research and healing. The 1st Department of Pathology and
Experimental Cancer Research, where the group is located, possesses over 150
