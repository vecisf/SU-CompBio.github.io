<h3>Gábor Bedics - PhD Student</h3>

My work in our institute focuses on next-generation sequencing and the related
bioinformatic analyses. In my PhD project I intend to create a molecular profile
of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in Hungary, using various NGS
methods. Beyond that project, I analyse NGS data from other oncologic samples
and work on a germline-NGS analysis project.

<h3>Benedek Dankó - MSc Student</h3>

I am studying for a master's degree in biology, with a bioinformatics
specialization at Eötvös Loránd University. My research topic covers the
transcriptional profiling of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and analysis of
databases related to this disease. Moreover, I am interested in human genetics,
cancer biology, bioinformatics and genomics.

<h3>Tamás Nádasi - Medical Student</h3>

I am a medical student at the Semmelweis University. It was my interest in genomics and systems biology that led me to this group. Initially, I am being introduced to the lab’s work through the analysis of transplant patients’ multigene panel tests. Prior to medical school, I completed my undergraduate education at the University of Rochester, and hold a BSc degree in Computational Biology.

<h3>Tibor Nagy - Bioinformatics System Administrator</h3>

My primary job is to keep the underlying software components of various analyses
run smoothly. I like making automatic workflows for large datasets and
optimizing existing analysis pipelines. I have diverse experience in bioinformatics,
as I did GWAS and RNA-seq analysis, metagenomics and de-novo assembly of the
genomes of unknown bacterial species.

<h3>Tamás Pór - Volunteer Research Assistant</h3>

I am a molecular biologist with a strong interest in computational biology.
After spending 10+ years in clinical research I turned back to academic
research, part time at least. My current project is the analysis of
transcriptional noise in cancer cells.

<h3>Endre Sebestyén - Group Leader</h3>

My main research interests are eukaryotic transcriptional and
post–transcriptional gene regulatory networks, their role in human disease and
how these networks are influenced by genetic variability, the environment or the
inherent noisiness and redundancy of molecular systems. Originally trained as a
molecular biologist, now I have more than 15 years of experience in various
aspects of computational and systems biology.

<h3>Alexa Szeifert - BSc Student</h3>

I am a molecular bionics engineering student at Pázmány Péter Catholic
University. Before joining the group, I was working on the pathogenetic role of
microRNAs in inflammatory diseases. At the moment, my project is on the
statistical analysis of RNA modifications in cancer. My main focus is analyzing
genome and transcriptome sequencing data of hematologic malignances and examine
the expression pattern of reader, writer and eraser enzyme coding genes in
different healthy and tumor tissues, besides their potential regulatory effects.

<h3>Veronika Vraukó - PhD Student</h3>

I am a PhD student in the Experimental Oncology program of Semmelweis University,
1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research. My doctoral
research examines the essentiality of biological functions in gene regulatory
networks and their role in cancer development and disease penetrance. During my
PhD work my focus is on bioinformatic and biostatistic methods, besides 
systems biology and biological network approaches. I graduated in Molecular
bionics engineering (University of Szeged) and have a master’s degree in Medical
biotechnology (Pázmány Péter Catholic University).
