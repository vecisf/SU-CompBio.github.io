<h3>Endre Sebestyén</h3>

I obtained my PhD in 2012 at the Eötvös Loránd University, in Classical and
Molecular Genetics, working on the bioinformatic analysis of eukaryotic
promoters and transcription factor binding sites in the group of Endre Barta.
After this, I joined the lab of Eduardo Eyras at UPF, Barcelona, working on the
role of alternative splicing in cancer development and using splicing patterns
as predictive and prognostic signatures of cancer. In 2015, I moved to the lab
of Francesco Ferrari at IFOM, Milan, where I worked on developing a novel
sequencing method to characterize large-scale chromatin structure, besides
analyzing whole-genome sequencing datasets to identify driver mutations in
non-coding enhancer regions.  My main interests are eukaryotic gene regulatory
networks and how/why they are changing in different pathologic conditions.

<h3>Peter Szikora</h3>

I am a master student in Medical Biotechnology at Pazmany Peter Catholic
University, focusing on molecular oncology and genomics. Before that I completed
my professional practice in the National Institute of Environmental Health,
working on the molecular analysis of pathogenic bacteria from hospital water
samples. I am currently studying and working on the analysis of genomic data and
gene regulatory networks for cancer research.


<h3>Noam Makmal</h3>
I am a medical student at Semmelweis University. Currently taking part in big data
analysis for cancer research.
