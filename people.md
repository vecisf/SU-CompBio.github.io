<h3>Endre Sebestyén</h3>

I obtained my PhD in 2012 at the [Eötvös Loránd
University](https://www.elte.hu/en/), in Classical and Molecular Genetics,
working on the bioinformatic analysis of eukaryotic promoters and transcription
factor binding sites in the group of [Endre Barta](https://abc.naik.hu/en/organizational-units/abc-department-of-genomics-agricultural-genomics-and-bioinformatics).
After this, I joined the lab of [Eduardo Eyras](http://comprna.upf.edu/) at UPF,
Barcelona, working on the role of alternative splicing in cancer development and
using splicing patterns as predictive and prognostic signatures of cancer. In
2015, I moved to the lab of [Francesco Ferrari](https://www.ifom.eu/en/cancer-research/research-labs/research-lab-ferrari.php)
at IFOM, Milan, where I worked on developing a novel sequencing method to
characterize large-scale chromatin structure, besides analyzing whole-genome
sequencing datasets to identify driver mutations in non-coding enhancer regions.
My main interests are eukaryotic gene regulatory networks and how they are
changing in different pathologic conditions.

<h3>Péter Szikora</h3>

I am finishing as a master student in Medical Biotechnology at [Pázmány Péter Catholic
University](https://itk.ppke.hu/en), focusing on molecular oncology and genomics.
Before that, I completed my professional practice at the National Institute of
Environmental Health, working on the molecular analysis of pathogenic bacteria
from hospital water samples. I am currently developing a bioinformatic workflow
and working on the analysis of large-scale transcriptome datasets, splicing patterns
and gene regulatory networks in cancer. Also I am working as a biological data analyst
at the company [Turbine](https://turbine.ai/).

<h3>Alexa Szeifert</h3>
I am a molecular bionics engineering student at [Pázmány Péter Catholic
University](https://ppke.hu/en). Before I joined the group I was working on the 
pathogenetic role of microRNAs in inflammatory diseases. Now, my project is 
about the statistical analysis of RNA modifications in cancer.

<h3>Gábor Bedics</h3>
I introduce myself as a PhD student at the Semmelweis University, Doctoral
School of Pathology. My work is divided to two groups: the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences - Semmelweis University Molecular Oncohematology Research Group with
the supervision of Dr. Donát Alpár, and between the Semmelweis University
Computational Biology Group with the supervision of Dr. Endre Sebestyén. The
field of research I work on is the genetic sequencing of pediatric acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the bioinformatical analysis of theese data in
order to identify mutations and give the opportunity for personalised therapy
for theese patients. I graduated as a Medical Doctor in 2019 at the University
of Pécs.

<h3>Veronika Vraukó</h3>
I am graduated in Molecular bionics engineering ((University of Szeged))[http://sci.u-szeged.hu/english] 
and have a master's degree in Medical biotechnology (Pázmány Péter Catholic University).
I gained more than 2 years of laboratory experience in several fields of research, 
including neurobiology, microbiology and molecular genetics as well. Now I am 
a PhD student at the Semmelweis University, (Doctoral School of Pathology)[http://semmelweis.hu/phd/en/], 
1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research. My theme is about 
transcriptional adaptation and minimal regulatory networks in cancer.

<h3>Alumni</h3>

<h4>Noam Makmal</h4>
I am a medical student at [Semmelweis University](http://semmelweis.hu/english/).
I was working on the analysis of genome, transcriptome and ChIP-seq datasets to
develop novel tools for characterizing variance in chromatin structure, link it
to oncogene or tumor suppressor gene expression and ultimately to cancer
development and clinical characteristics of patients.

<h4>András Udvarvölgyi</h4>
I am a biochemical engineering student at [Budapest University of Technology and
Economics](http://www.bme.hu/?language=en).  My project was about panel
sequencing and evaluating raw sequencing data. The goal was to find patterns and
similarities among the different samples, which were collected from Hungarian
patients with cancer.
