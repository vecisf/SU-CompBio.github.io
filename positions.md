Fully-funded open positions and other opportunities will be posted in the Group
News section. If you don't see anything current there, but are still interested
in working with the group as an MSc student, PhD student or postdoc, drop us an
email with the following information. Application procedure for a specific
position in the Group News section might be slightly different from the one
described here.

<h3>If you are an MSc student looking for a thesis/TDK topic</h3>

- Make sure that your university/department agrees doing your thesis with us.
- Write an email with a short description of who you are, what would you like
  to do, and why us.

<h3>If you are looking for a PhD program</h3>

- Make sure that you are eligible/willing to apply for the [Semmelweis PhD
  School](http://phd.semmelweis.hu/en/) fellowships or external funding.
  Although the number of fully funded fellowships at the university are limited,
  external funding might be available through Stipendium Hungaricum (see below)
  or other means.
- Write an email with your CV, 2 reference letters, a one paragraph summary of
  your most significant scientific contribution, and another paragraph on what
  you would like to do with us combined into a single pdf. The topic should be
  broadly connected to what we already do. The "scientific contribution" might
  be anything ranging from a conference poster to an interesting dataset, or an
  R package, not only publications. However, it must be available online, for
  example at [GitHub](https://github.com/), [figshare](https://figshare.com/),
  [zenodo](http://zenodo.org/), [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), etc.

<h3>If you are looking for a postdoc position</h3>

- Make sure that you are eligible/willing to apply for external funding.
- Write an email with your CV, list of publications, a one paragraph summary of
  your most significant scientific contribution and another paragraph on what
  you would like to do with us. As long as the idea is interesting and even
  remotely connected to cancer and molecular biology, we can discuss. Also, as
  above, "scientific contribution" might mean different things.

<h3>External funding opportunities</h3>

These are some of the funding opportunities for PhD students and postdocs.
Although the chances might be low for some of them, as we are a new group, you
can always give it a try and we would be happy to help. There might be other
options worth considering.
