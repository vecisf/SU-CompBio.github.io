This is an evolving list of papers, how-tos, large-scale genomics datasets,
computing resources and other interesting things.

<h3>Reading material for genomics, bioinformatics and science</h3>

- [A collection of papers for absolute
  beginners](https://github.com/esebesty/bioinf_starter_pack), on
  reproducibility, version control, bioinformatics pipelines, statistics, Linux
  and programming.
- [Reading list](https://github.com/esebesty/reading_list) to get you started in
  computational biology, cancer, genomics, transcriptomics, chromatin and
  molecular biology in general.
- A rather short guide on [how to survive in the
  lab](https://github.com/esebesty/lab_guide). Trying to improve it in the near
  future.
- Jeff Leek has a bunch of guides on how to [share
  data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), [develop an R
  package](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages), [give a
  talk](https://github.com/jtleek/talkguide), [write your first
  paper](https://github.com/jtleek/firstpaper), [read
  papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers), [review
  papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews), [plan your
  career](https://github.com/jtleek/careerplanning).
